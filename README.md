# Family Tree
Self project on creating family tree

# Links
Used [kingraph](https://github.com/rstacruz/kingraph) to visualize this family tree

# Issue with very large families
Followed [these](https://github.com/rstacruz/kingraph/issues/6) steps to resolve this problem

I fixed this by changing the totalMemory variable in viz.js

Location of the viz.js -> C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\kingraph\node_modules\viz.js
